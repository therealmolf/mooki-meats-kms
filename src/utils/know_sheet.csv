Information,"Improving hydration, cooking and cooling, and de-flavoring of plant-based proteins in the manufacture of meat substitutes","Dry beans, lentils and peas are a popular and growing choice in the diet of Americans. Factors driving the growth in consumption of pulses include widespread interest in ethnic foods and changes in Americans dietary awareness. As a group they are one of the most nutritionally-complete foods, inexpensive and widely available. High in protein, fiber and carbohydrates, and low in fat, these black beans, pinto beans, garbanzo beans, soybeans, lentils and peas have become a healthy and popular substitute for meat.

Expanding Market for Meat Substitutes
The trend toward vegan, vegetarian and flexitarian diets is greatly influencing the use of plant-based proteins as meat and seafood substitutes. Market analysis prepared by The Good Food Institute (GFI) and the Plant Based Foods Association (PBFA), the trade association representing more than 160 plant-based food companies, reports that in 2019 the plant-based meat category alone was worth more than $939 million worldwide annually, with sales up18.4 percent compared to the prior year, and up 37.9 percent over the prior two years.  More than 208 million units of plant-based meat were sold in 2019.

Leading this category are products such as Beyond Meat, which makes beef, sausage and beef crumbles under the brand Beyond, using primarily pea protein isolate. Impossible Foods produces the Impossible Burger, using soy protein concentrate, soy-protein isolate and potato protein. Soy and wheat-based proteins are also used in the Awesome Burger and Incredible Burger from Nestlé. Kraft Foods produces BOCA meatless patties using soy protein concentrate, isolated soy protein, and hydrolyzed soy protein as the main plant-based protein ingredients. And Good Catch Foods offers tuna substitutes using a blend of lentils, peas, chickpeas, soy and fava beans, like Naked in Water, that capture the taste and texture of real tuna.

Processing for Taste and Texture
To achieve the desired taste and texture for plant-based meat substitutes, manufacturers prepare pulses by subjecting them to processes such as hydration, cooking, de-flavoring, pasteurization and cooling. A wide range of product characteristics can be achieved by altering these process conditions. Supplemental ingredients and flavorings are added to arrive at proprietary blends. High-moisture extrusion and shear cell processes are used to define the texture and shape of the products, then molded into forms such as crumbles, strips, patties and sausages.

This article will focus on some of the latest processing technology related to hydration, cooking and cooling, de-flavoring and pouch cooling after pasteurization.

Continuous Processing
Over the past 40 years, continuous processing technology in the handling of pulses for cooking and cooling has evolved far beyond quality and throughput expectations of batch processes.  Processing labor hours have reduced to a fraction of what batch systems require.

Continuous process systems slowly move pulses through an enclosed perforated drum resulting in the product being submerged in water, using an auger or screw to control dwell times. The pulses are hydrated, cooked and cooled to the same degree throughout their movement in the drum from entry to exit, ensuring uniform first-in/first-out (FI/FO) processing.

The conventional method of continuous process uses a rotary drum, where the enclosed auger/drum assembly rotates as one cylinder. A more recent continuous design has the auger rotating while residing within a stationary wedge-wire screen.  Each system has its advantages with processing pulses, depending on the need for gentle product handling, and changeover and cleaning requirements.

Aided by the integration of pre-programmed PLCs that ensure a precisely controlled process and recipe management, continuous-processing systems deliver precise automated control of hydration, cook and cool functions, resulting in uniform heating and cooling that achieves a totally consistent end product.

The most advanced of these continuous-process systems have the added benefit of providing an exceptionally low product damage rate of less than 1 percent.  Supporting this has been the development of two technologies that ensured more uniform processes, and allowed cookers and coolers to handle higher throughputs.

The first is a gentle mechanical stirring action on the pulses as they progress through the machine. The other is a system called Hydro-Flow, which applies water injection that puts the pulses in suspension, more evenly distributing the product loading across the width of the machine, and uniformly treating each particle.

Much of the technological developments integrated into continuous-process cookers and coolers, such as Hydro-Flow, were developed by Lyco Manufacturing, a leading manufacturer of commercial cooking and cooling systems for food processors.  These improvements have helped push the acceptance of continuous processing, where now, more than 50 percent of the dry bean market has adapted to continuous over batch systems.

Hydration
Hydration in pulse processing is necessary to prepare the pulse for subsequent cooking or extrusion, by increasing water weight from a dry state of approximately 12 percent moisture to as much as 58 percent moisture.

""For hydration, continuous systems are much more effective than conveyor systems and static soak tanks of water,"" said Jeff Zittel, Vice President of Sales, Marketing, Applications Engineering and Service, with Lyco. ""Hydration times are reduced from as much as from 4 to12 hours, to 1 hour or less, which is a huge improvement in productivity for processors of plant-based proteins.""

Cooking and Cooling
Cooking and cooling plays a critical role in the processing of plant-based proteins for meat substitutes. They can be used to modify the outer texture of extruded soy products, as well as enabling the extruded pieces to be easily pulled into fibers resembling real meat. But for a growing number of processors of these meat substitutes the need for higher capacity lines with faster product change-overs has become a topline issue.

“Food processors have become increasingly concerned about food safety, quick change-overs, and faster clean-up time and turn-around time,” said Zittel. “This trend is taking place around the globe to accommodate the needs of more diverse consumers, and particularly so with the manufacture of ready-to-eat meals, and cooking and cooling plant-based proteins for meat substitutes.”

A recently-released continuous-processing system, called Clean-Flow, addresses this need, applicable to both cooking and cooling of pulses.

The Clean-Flow design begins with a very accurately made screw auger, similar to what is used in the systems mentioned prior. The auger resides in a stationary wedge-wire screen that encapsulates the screw from the 3:00 to 9:00 o’clock position. The tolerance between the screw and the screen is less than one-half a grain of rice.  Water agitation via Hydro-Flow is injected through the screen which keeps the pulse product off from the floor of the screen, where it is maintained in total suspension. The pulse runs through the cooking Clean-Flow system, then is immediately put through another Clean-Flow cooling system to stop the cooking process. Damage to fragile pulses amounts to a fraction of one percent.

""A very unique aspect of this system is attributed to its namesake,"" added Zittel. ""Clean-Flow is designed to reduce clean up from hours to minutes, because the screw is totally exposed for cleaning. During clean-up the wedge-wire screen is released from its fixed position, and is continually rotated 360 degrees around the screw alternately exposing the interior and exterior of the screen to clean-in-place (CIP) manifolds located in the cover of the machine. The screw can be rotated at the same time as the screen, again exposing all surfaces to the cleansing water sprays. The CIP can clean more than 98 percent of the machine without manual intervention."" 

De-flavoring
Despite the growing interest in using plant-based pulse proteins as meat substitutes, their flavor often can limit their use. Eliminating undesirable aroma and flavor properties provides a greater opportunity for the inclusion of pulse proteins in foods.

De-flavoring removes the bitter taste from garbanzo beans, yellow split peas, lentils and other pulses. The process is optimally accomplished by steaming. One advanced continuous system that is particularly well suited for de-flavoring is the Vapor-Flow steam cooker.  The pulse is transported through the machine by an auger wrapped with a perforated screen. Steam is injected at the base of the cylinder at multiple points. The rotating auger ensures uniform heat penetration throughout the entire product load depth.

Another recently-released system, called Pressure-Flow, is a continuous cooker that is an ideal system for de-flavoring pulses. It reduces pulse cook times from 45 minutes down to 8 minutes or less. The system was specifically designed to hydrate, par-cook or fully-cook pulses, grains and other particulates. It provides plant-based protein processors with a unique continuous first-in/first-out pressure cooker, while offering the latest in fully-automated Clean-Flow technology in a pressure vessel.

Pouch Cooling after Pasteurization
""Flexible packaging/pouches are a convenient, portable and environmentally-friendly method to package processed plant-based proteins, and particularly fully-processed meat substitutes, for food service and retail markets,"" explained Zittel. ""Once product is processed and put into a package or pouch it can be pasteurized.""

After pasteurization, the pouched product needs to be cooled.  Water is the most economical and efficient medium for transferring or removing the heat. Cooling time depends upon the product, density, weight and recipe, and can vary from 20 to 120 minutes. USDA Regulations dictate that final product temperature must be close to 40°F or lower within a given period of time. It is important that pouches pass through the danger zone (130°F to 80°F) rapidly where bacteria are most likely to proliferate. Pouches may vary from a few ounces to more than 10 pounds, and in every case gradual cooling is important so as not to freeze the exterior while the core remains warm.

Cooling pouched plant-based proteins in the form of strips, burgers, sausages and crumbles is effectively achieved with a continuous system called Chill-Flow, which represents a state-of-the-art system for pouch cooling.

This system functions as a rotating drum with an attached auger, and a perforated skin sheet wrapped around it that is fixed to the auger flights so to eliminate pinch points.  These flights gently move the pouches through the system.  The pouches are carefully agitated with Hydro-Flow, turned over and massaged, while totally submersed in water that is 33 degrees F as they advance through the cylinder. Much more energy efficient than air cooling, water deluge belts or belt freezer methods. Once through the system – in a FI/FO sequence – the pouches, now at 40° F, are then gently deposited out of the system for subsequent packaging and storage in a freezer. Product damage is near zero percent.

A Better Solution
""Food manufacturers are approaching the processing of plant-based meat substitutes from many different perspectives – from the selection and blending of pulses, to the systems employed to achieve final products,"" added Zittel.

But the preparation of these dry beans, lentils, soy beans and peas for processing into plant-based meat substitutes is increasingly becoming standardized with the use of continuous-processing systems. These highly-automated systems maintain precise control over time, temperature and moisture, enabling higher throughput, a better ROI, and most importantly a more standardized and better quality product.

Information,Public Health Considerations,"Farmed Meat
Consumption of farmed meat, as well as fish and other “seafood,” and being in or near animal farming operations, pose several public health risk factors and consequences. Diets with high levels of animal product consumption have been linked to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer.  Red meat contains high levels of the amino acid derivative L-carnitine, with new research suggesting it plays a role in the production of metabolites associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and inflammatory bowel disease. While regular consumption of seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids is linked with health benefits such as reduced cardiovascular disease risk and improved cognitive development in human infants, there are not enough fish, both wild-caught and farmed, available for everyone globally to consume at recommended levels to capture these health benefits. 

Many pathogens that cause foodborne illness (Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter, and Listeria, for example) live in the guts of animals, and can then enter the food supply from animal manure runoff and irrigation water contamination, or through cross-contamination with meat if digestive tracts are severed during slaughter and processing. 

Workers in farmed meat operations can be exposed to zoonotic pathogens and contend with bacterial infections; an estimated 25% of such workers in indoor operations suffer from a respiratory illness. 

People living near farmed meat facilities also face health risks from waterborne bacterial and chemical hazards from these operations, in addition to respiratory hazards and exposure to zoonotic pathogens.

Plant-Based Meat
Plant-based meats often have a comparable nutritional profile (calories, protein, and iron) to the meats they are designed to replace. They are food products that are typically primarily composed of wheat gluten, pea protein, or soy protein isolates, have undergone high levels of processing, often have high levels of sodium, and contain additives such as flavorings, colorings, and binding agents. The inclusion of coconut oil in some plant-based meats results in a saturated fat content similar to or higher than chicken or pig meat, but lower than that of cow meat. There is little evidence so far whether these ingredients and additives are beneficial or harmful to human health. 

In contrast to plant-based meats, there is stronger evidence in the literature that less-processed soy foods such as tofu, tempeh, and soymilk, are associated with health benefits such as improved blood lipid levels, bone health, and reduced risks of type 2 diabetes and breast cancer. One plant-based meat additive that deserves further consideration though is heme iron, in the form of soy leghemoglobin, used specifically in products manufactured by Impossible Foods; since high levels of heme iron consumption from animal products is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, colorectal disease and cancer, and lung cancer, there may be a similar disease risk resulting from consumption of Impossible Foods products.

The chiefly known food safety concern of plant-based meats are allergens, as plant-based meat products commonly contain wheat and soy. Rarer allergic reactions can result from pea protein, lupin protein, and mycoprotein. Additives and gums in some plant-based meat products may also aggravate intolerances; carrageenan has the potential to cause gastrointestinal inflammation, alter intestinal microflora, and may be related to irritable bowel syndrome and colon cancer.

There is relatively little research on occupational exposure risks in plant-based meat manufacturing, but it is probably less hazardous compared to the risks faced by workers in farmed meat operations. There is concern about the exposure of workers in plant-based meat production to hexane, which is a solvent that can be used to process soy and pea protein isolates; hexane is neurotoxic and is a hazardous air pollutant. Little data exists on the magnitude of hexane usage in plant-based meat manufacturing, or on measures by plant-based meat manufacturing facilities to protect workers, prevent environmental releases, and monitor exposures to hexane.

Of course, plant-based meat production relies heavily on crops, such as soy, wheat, and corn, which contribute to groundwater contamination due to nutrient runoff. The production of these crops often requires pesticide, herbicide, and fungicide application, which are associated with health problems for people working on and living near farms. The use of herbicides and fungicides also pose the potential for inducing resistance in pathogens and fungi to antibiotics and anti-fungal medicines, respectively. Still, a soy-based plant-based meat product requires far less soy production than a comparable farmed meat product that uses much more soy as an input for animal feed.

Cell-Based Meat
Since cell-based meats are still in their development and prototyping stage, there is little information about their nutritional profiles and associated health consequences. It is still unclear if it is technically feasible to exactly replicate farmed meat in vitro. However, cell-based meat does present the opportunity of enhanced nutritional profiles compared to farmed meat, through fortification of the product with vitamins or omega-3 fatty acids.

Cell-based meat production could theoretically reduce the incidence of foodborne illness if produced in sterile environments, since animal carcass processing would not be involved. Fully sterile conditions are practically difficult to attain and antibiotics would probably still need to be applied to the tissue culture medium to suppress bacterial pathogens, though the antibiotic usage would likely be less intense compared to farmed meat operations.

Occupational safety concerns related to cell-based meat are unclear due to the many unknowns of manufacturing processes and regulatory requirements surrounding cell-based meat production.

Finally, it is unclear whether the antibiotic usage and waste management practices involved with cell-based meat production pose risks to people who work on or live near such production facilities.

Information,Emerging Sources of Protein: Insect,"4.2. Insect
Insect consumption (entomophagy), whereby eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of certain insects are
consumed by humans, has occurred for thousands of years. Approximately 2000 species of insects
have been used as food [71] and they are part of the traditional diets of at least 2 billion people [72],
particularly in parts of Asia, Africa and South America where they provide important livelihood
opportunities. Beetles are the most commonly consumed insects (31%), followed by caterpillars
(18%); bees, wasps and ants (14%); grasshoppers, locusts and crickets (13%); cicadas, leafhoppers,
planthoppers, scale insects and true bugs (10%); termites (3%); dragonflies (3); flies (2%); and others
(5%) [72]. However, more recently, insects have been identified as an alternative source of protein for
the Western world, not only as a delicacy or for emergency nutrition [73], supported by organizations
such as the FAO [72] and the European Commission. Crickets, lesser mealworm and yellow mealworm
are potential insects for application for food in the EU while black soldier fly, yellow mealworm and
the common housefly have potential for use in feed products [13].
Proponents of entomophagy argue that it has a lower environmental impact compared to meat
production [74]. Significantly, they argue that insects do not compete for land, require less water and
emit lower levels of greenhouse gases and NH3 than regular livestock. They can be reared on organic
side-streams thus creating value from and reducing waste products. However, the environmental
impact of insect production is significantly influenced by insect’s diet, which in turn influences whether
it can be used for food or feed purposes [75]. Another environmental advantage is that up to 80%
of body weight is edible and digestible compared to 55% for chicken and 40% for cattle [35]. Being
cold-blooded, they perform better in terms of feed conversion efficiency, and they reproduce more
rapidly [76]. Many insects also have a favourable nutritional profile for humans, with most being
highly digestible (77–98%), high in protein (crude protein 40–75% on a dry weight basis) [10] and
a good source of essential amino acids, high in vitamins B1, B2 and B3 and the minerals iron and
zinc [77]. However, many insects are deficient in certain amino acids, including tryptophan and lysine,
and those with chitin exoskeletons have lower levels of digestibility. Insects vary considerably in fat,
and thus energy levels, with some insects recorded as having 77 g/100 g dry weight. Some research
Foods 2017, 6, 53 11 of 21
argues that insects pose less risk of transmitting zoonotic diseases to humans, compared to animals
and birds [72].
Most insects are, however, still collected from their natural environment (usually forests), which
restricts supply according to season and location [78]. Furthermore, some researchers question
insect consumption from a food safety perspective, arguing that the safety of insects as food is
under-researched [77]. While insects are similar to other animal-derived products in that they are rich
in nutrients and moisture (providing a medium for growth of unwanted microorganisms in certain
conditions), the fact that insects are phylogenetically far removed from mammals, birds and some
aquatic species regularly consumed as food means that significant differences are expected when
making comparisons between them in terms of risks [77]. Furthermore, many insects are consumed
whole, which includes their gut microflora which may affect microbiological quality of the food
product [10] and specific health implications associated with using organic feedstocks to produce the
insects need to be assessed (for example (undesirable) substrate materials can be transferred into the
protein products and thus into the human food chain).
Notwithstanding long traditions of domestication of bees and silk worms, and the practice of
rearing insects for biological control, health and pollination [72] commercial insect farming for food
purposes is only beginning to evolve, largely in proximity to concentrations of consumers. While
insects are an established part of food culture in some countries and are eaten out of choice, there is
evidence of some reluctance by Western consumers to accept insects as food as they are often considered
as pests, and a source of contamination, and thus to be avoided. Van Huis and colleagues [72] relate
the absence of a history of consuming insects to the difficulty of harvesting a proper meal of insects in
temperate zones (insects tend to be less abundant, smaller and found less often in clumps in temperate
zones). Nonetheless, food products are available on the market including cricket protein bars produced
by British company Next Step Foods, and are on the shelves in European supermarkets including the
Belgian supermarkets Delhaize and Carrefour. Widespread adoption of insects for food purposes will
not however be achieved based on communicating their environmental and nutritional benefits. It
will be dependent on addressing what Rozin and Fallon [79] identify as three important motives that
lead to product rejection: negative sensory properties (distaste), harmful consequences (perceived
danger) and “ideational” factors. Given that physical state is often used as a heuristic to evaluate
food, processing insect protein to render it into an unrecognizable (e.g., as an ingredient in a familiar
product) could be a productive strategy. Similarly, ensuring insects and insect-based products are
acceptable from a sensory perspective and are safe to eat will be critical.
The Belgian food safety authority allowed the sale of ten different types of insects for food
consumption in 2013 following a federal ruling. However, the EU novel food regulation does not
yet allow insects for human consumption to be sold. Regulatory changes are expected but it is not
clear when this will happen, which means companies are currently focusing on insects for animal
feed and pet food rather than human consumption. Commercial production of insects for human
consumption will require the establishment of new value chains. Given that they are most likely to be
accepted as ingredients rather than whole, such a chain includes ensuring a safe and reliable feedstock
for the insect, mass rearing of insect larvae, their processing into insect ingredients, and application of
these ingredients in final food products. All of these activities need to be developed simultaneously,
resulting in costs and risks. Some organizations and commercial companies are setting up production
on an industrial scale, e.g., the FAO established an insect farming project in the Philippines in 2010 [80],
Swiss company Bühler is setting up pilot facility in China to process fly larvae and mealworms, and
there are a few industrial scale enterprises in various stages of start-up within Europe for raising insects
such as black soldier flies. The establishment of a trade group called International Platform for Insects
for Food and Feed (IPIFF) is also significant. Nonetheless, current primary production systems remain
expensive, with a need to develop automation processes to make insect production economically
competitive; extraction processing systems are also too costly and need further development [72].

Information,Downsides of Textured Vegetable Protein,"What are the disadvantages of TVP?
The main disadvantages of including this product in your diet include:

Difficulty digesting soy properly — When soy is not fermented (soaked and sprouted), it can be hard to break down due to antinutrients it contains, which block some of its minerals from being absorbed. This is one reason why fermented soy products are usually a better option, such as tempeh, miso or organic tofu.
Possible allergenic reactions to soy — Soy is a common allergen and can cause side effects among some people, such as indigestion, rashes, hives and even serious complications, including anaphylaxis.
Likely to be GMO — The vast majority of soy grown in the United States is genetically modified. Look for certified organic TVP if you do decide to purchase it.
Potential affects on hormonal balance — Soy is a unique food because it’s high in compounds called isoflavones, which are a type of plant estrogen (or phytoestrogen). Phytoestrogens have the ability to act like human estrogen in the body, which sometimes has an effect on hormones if you eat lots of soy products on a regular basis.
Possibility of consuming other harmful ingredients — Because TVP is found in mostly processed foods, you’re likely to consume additives, preservatives, lots of sodium and added sugar, and other unwanted ingredients if you consume a lot of products that contain it. Plus, there’s a small risk of consuming solvents that are left lingering in TVP due to the manufacturing process.",2/3/2022,Cassandra Moore,Approved
Information,PDCAAS,"PDCAAS is a method of evaluating the quality of a protein and was adopted by US FDA & FAO/WHO in 1993.

The equation is as follows: Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score

In the U.S., PDCAAS can be important for food labeling. When a protein claim is made, PDCAAS is used to calculate the %DV on the Nutrition 
Facts panel. Protein complementation can be used to enhance %DV within a product. 
(%DV = percent daily value = protein grams/ daily requirement, protein grams = protein per serving * PDCAAS)
PDCAAS is often used to calculate (and optimize for) protein quality via food combination based on the debunked idea of protein 
complementation. Amino Acid Score is of low importance (except for severely restricted diets), as the body can store amino acids across 
mealtimes. Also, Protein Digestibility is typically high (>0.75). 
PDCAAS doesn’t consider antinutritional factors (e.g., trypsin inhibitors) and non-absorptive losses (e.g., large intestine microflora). In 2013, 
FAO proposed changing to DIAAS (Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score) which measures digestibility at the end of the small intestine.

Information,Increasing Acceptance,"Our previous review included some studies which showed that additional information about
cultured meat could influence consumers’ views, and that less technical explanations and higher
perceived market share were associated with increased acceptance [12,39,40,69]. This section will
discuss experimental studies which demonstrated an effect on acceptance of certain interventions.
Several recent studies have demonstrated that cultured meat acceptance can be increased by
providing additional positive information. Zhang, Li and Bai [33] found that providing additional
information about the environmental benefits of cultured meat increased acceptance amongst urban
Chinese consumers. Mancini and Antonioli [18] found that providing additional positive information
about cultured meat significantly increased the various measures of acceptance including the willingness
to buy, but not the willingness to try.
Rolland et al. [19] found that additional information about the various benefits of cultured
meat significantly increased acceptance, and tasting what participants thought to be cultured meat
significantly increased acceptance further. The authors tested three types of information (societal
benefits, personal benefits, and meat quality and taste). They found that, while all three led to significant
increases in acceptance, information about the personal benefits led to a significantly greater increase
than the other information conditions. This provides evidence that messages aiming to persuade
consumers to adopt cultured meat should focus primarily on the benefits to the consumer (rather than
the benefits to society, the environment, or animals). Verbeke et al. [53] noted that the latter tend to be
more obvious to participants to begin with.
Nomenclature and terminology are also important. Bryant and Barnett [14] found that different
names had a significant effect on the measures of acceptance. We found that “clean meat” led to a
significantly higher acceptance than “lab grown meat”, with “cultured meat” and “animal-free meat”
scoring somewhere in between. Further, we showed that the difference between groups was accounted
for by the positivity of associations participants gave. This indicates that the mechanism by which
nomenclature affects acceptance is by anchoring to concepts which are more or less appealing in the
context. Similarly, Geipel et al. [16] found that German participants reading about cultured meat in
their non-native English (vs. their native German) experienced less disgust, and subsequently had a
higher willingness to eat it. The authors note that this foreign language effect has been observed in
other contexts, appearing to make people behave in a more utilitarian manner [70].

Information,Protein Demand,"In addition to increased demand arising from population growth, increased demand for protein
globally is driven by socio-economic changes such as rising incomes, increased urbanisation, and aging
populations whereby the contribution of protein to healthy aging is increasingly recognised [5,6], and
recognition of the role of protein in a healthy diet. Economic development and increased urbanization
is leading to major transitions in population-level dietary patterns in low and middle income countries
in particular, such that most of the global increases in demand for foods of animal origin are seen
in developing countries [6]. Some forces, however, provide a countervailing force slowing demand
in developed countries. Such factors include increased awareness of the impact of food production
and consumption on the environment and on health. In the context of protein, the negative impact is
mainly associated with animal-derived protein with reports that 12% of GHG emissions derive from
livestock production and that 30% of human-induced terrestrial biodiversity loss can be attributed to
animal production [2]. Land use is also a concern; for example, in the EU two thirds of total agricultural
area is used for livestock production and around 75% of protein-rich animal feed is imported from
South America using large tracts of land there also [2]. Health concerns arise with over-consumption of
protein, particularly when linked with saturated fatty acids and over consumption of processed meats.
Ethical issues about animal production could also stifle demand with a trend towards flexitarianism
and initiatives aimed at reducing meat consumption evident in some markets",11/16/2020,Kaitlin Roth,Approved
Information,Regulatory Framework,"PBMs are regulated in a similar manner as other non-animal foods. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and specifically the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), oversees food inspection, labeling, packaging, imports, and facility safety. Most PBM products contain simple ingredients that have previously been approved for human consumption. Novel ingredients may be subject to additional evaluation processes. For example, soy leghemoglobin, produced via genetic engineering, filed for “generally recognized as safe” status with the FDA for use as a color additive17. In the European Union (EU), current policy and regulation are supportive for alternative proteins innovation and investment. In 2018, the European Commission presented a “EU Protein Plan”, which encourages the production of alternative proteins for human consumption, and listed existing EU policy instruments that “provide options for strengthening the development of EU-grown plant proteins”. Many novel PBM products are classified under the Novel Food Regulation which regulates “food that had not been consumed or do not exist in the EU before 15 May 1997”23. Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have also introduced legislation to guide oversight of novel foods13. Government oversight is also required for food labeling. In 2018, The United States Cattlemen’s Association petitioned the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) “to exclude products not derived directly from animals raised and slaughtered from the definition of “beef” and “meat”29. The use of terms such as steak, sausage, bacon, fillet, etc. for PBMs is subject to scrutiny and restriction in many EU member states as well.
